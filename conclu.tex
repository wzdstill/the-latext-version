\section{Conclusion and Open Problems}  
We presented a lattice-based inner product encryption scheme whose security follows from the difficulty of the $learning~with~errors (\LWE)$ problem.Our construction has  more compact public key and ciphertexts size than precious lattice-based IPE scheme. We also used the techniques to construct a hierarchical inner product encryption scheme and a fuzzy identity-based encryption scheme, the efficiency of the two schemes is better than prior works. Our scheme is weakly attribute hiding in the selective security model, constructing a scheme that is adaptive (fully) security or fully attribute hiding are important open problems.
