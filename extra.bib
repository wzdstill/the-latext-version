abstract="We revisit the problem of generating a `hard' random lattice together with a basis of relatively short vectors. This problem has gained in importance lately due to new cryptographic schemes that use such a procedure to generate public/secret key pairs. In these applications, a shorter basis corresponds to milder underlying complexity assumptions and smaller key sizes.",
